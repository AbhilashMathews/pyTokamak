Tokamak utilities in Python
===========================

B.Dudson, University of York

Routines for reading tokamak equilibria, calculating flux-surface
quantites such as safety factor, collision frequencies, and trapped
particle fraction. Neoclassical viscosities and Bootstrap current
calculation using Hirshman-Sigmar formalism


tokamak.equilibrium        Defines classes FluxSurface and Equilibrium
                           for iterating over and performing calculations
                           on flux surfaces

tokamak.neoclass           Neoclassical theory calculations

tokamak.formats.dskgato    Reads DSKGATO 't' files
tokamak.formats.elite      Reads ELITE .inp files


Requirements
============

NumPy

If SciPy is available, then this is used for the erf and integrate.quad functions.
Otherwise fall-back implementations are used
